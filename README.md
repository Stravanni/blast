# BLAST

## Source code
The current version of **blast** (this one) is implemented as part of the BlockingFramework [[1]](#papadakis2013).

So, in this repo you will find the [BlockingFramework source code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/erframework/), and the following parts implementing the blast approach:
- The AttributeClusteringBlocking.java class has been implemented to support LSH
- EntopryExtraction and MetaBlocking proposed in blast will be **soon updated here** (in the branch you can find the old version though).
