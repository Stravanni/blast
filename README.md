# blast

## Source code
The current version of **blast** is implemented as part of the [BlockingFramework - link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/erframework/)

- The AttributeClusteringBlocking.java class has been implemented to support LSH
- The EntopryExtraction and MetaBlocking proposed in blast will be soon updated here (in the branch you can find the old version though).
